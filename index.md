# About Me

Hi, my name is Falah, also known as Xx_FROSTBITExX on ROBLOX. 
I joined ROBLOX in April of 2017 and was instantly drawn in by the idea of creating something fun.
I decided to give scripting a go and to my suprise I ended up liking it.
As of 2024, I have over 4 years of experience scripting and 2 years of experience building.
I also dabble in a bit of UI designing.

# My Work

_The following are examples of my builds._

## Scripting
_The following are examples of things I have scripted._

A simple head bob that uses trigonometry to create an effect when the player is walking. 
My solution to the head bob is open sourced and can be found at [This devforum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/creating-steady-camera-head-bob/1510676/3)

Modelling the particles' motion uses calculus to obtain a path relative to the properties of the particle.
