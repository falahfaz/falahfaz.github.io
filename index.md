# About Me

Hi, my name is Falah, also known as Xx_FROSTBITExX on ROBLOX. 
I joined ROBLOX in April of 2017 and was instantly drawn in by the idea of creating something fun.
I decided to give scripting a go and to my suprise I ended up liking it.
As of 2024, I have over 4 years of experience scripting and 2 years of experience building.
I also dabble in a bit of UI designing.

# My Work

## Building
_The following are examples of my builds._

## Scripting
_The following are examples of things I have scripted._

![Head Bob](https://github.com/falahfaz/falahfaz.github.io/assets/140397265/662dece2-377d-4885-8ee3-bc2008a212bb)
- The head bob uses simple trigonometry to create an effect when the player is walking.

![Particle Motion](https://github.com/falahfaz/falahfaz.github.io/assets/140397265/6d46e0b2-968e-4273-8d09-01338971af74)
- Modelling the particles' motion uses calculus to obtain a path relative to the properties of the particle.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
